    Heed is a small software company based in London, where I have spent the
    past year.
    <br />
    The majority of my work here was building the front end for a new automated
    dialling application, Callbots. <br /> I was also responsible for building a
    new support portal, for Heeds existing actionable alert system software, to
    integrate with a Jira support ticket system. <br />
    Technologies used include React, Node, AWS Lambda, Cognito and DynamoDB.
