    I graduated from the university of Bristol in summer 2016 with a 2.1 in
    Physics.
    <br />
    Here I touched on programming in C, to solve physical problems, like finding
    the optimal route for a projectiles trip to the moon, and to return safely.
    <br />
    The most exciting part of the course was a group project ‘Underwater
    robotics and positioning systems’. My role within the team was mainly
    technical, duties included programming Arduinos, CAD and 3D printing. Here I
    advanced my team working and communication skills leading to a successful
    project, which we presented a prototype to our client, Sellafield.
