    I graduated from the university of Bristol in summer 2016 with a 2.1 in
    Physics. Here I touched on programming in C, to solve physical problems,
    like finding the optimal route for a projectiles trip to the moon, and to
    return safely.
    <br />
    The most exciting part of the course was a group project ‘Underwater
    robotics and positioning systems’. This was a group project developing an
    underwater positioning system. My role within the team was mainly technical,
    duties included programming Arduinos, CAD and 3D printing. Here I advanced
    my team working and communication skills leading to a successful group
    project, where we presented a prototype to our client, Sellafield. <br />
