    Having just finished university, I spent 6 months working for a marquee
    company in West Sussex, erecting marquees for large events suc as weddings.
    <br />
    While doing this I was working my way through the courses found on{" "}
    <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a>, teaching myself
    javascript and reminding myself of the HTML and css I had used previously.
